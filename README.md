Gunnner
=======

[Gunnner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gunnner)<sup>1</sup> is a handy Dribbble client for Android.

The Gunnner app lets you:

- Browse Debuts, Everyone and Popular feeds on Dribbble
- Browse your likes, your shots and shots you're following
- Browse players' <b>profiles</b> as well as their shots
- <b>Zoom</b> in images to see every detail
- Open <b>GIFs</b> right in the app
- <b>Share</b> shots you want other people to see
- Swipe back to close the shot

<sub><sup>1</sup> A person who is competitive, ambitious and substantially exceeds minimum requirements.</sub>

Development
-----------

Right now Dribbble API doesn't have write-access, but they are planning to implement it. A soon as they make it [public](https://dribbble.com/shots/1680023), I am planning to update Gunnner.

I am open to pull-requests and will gladly review review each one.
